//! At-rest encryption for the local redb database via Windows DPAPI.
//!
//! `CryptProtectData` / `CryptUnprotectData` derive an encryption key from
//! the user's Windows credentials. The encrypted bytes are only readable
//! from the same user account on the same machine — copying the database
//! file to another PC or another user account yields opaque bytes.
//!
//! Why DPAPI specifically:
//! - **No password to manage** — users don't have to set up or remember
//!   a master password. The OS holds the key material.
//! - **No external dependencies** — no key files, no TPM, no network. The
//!   protection is built into Windows itself.
//! - **Per-user scope** — matches our threat model: "anyone with physical
//!   access to the user's logged-in account can already see this data; we
//!   only need to protect against another user account on the same box,
//!   or someone reading the disk after a fresh OS install."
//!
//! Trade-offs:
//! - **Not portable** — the encrypted blob can't be opened from another
//!   machine. That's by design: a "local-first" app shouldn't have its
//!   data trivially portable in encrypted form either.
//! - **Reinstall Windows = data loss** — DPAPI master keys are stored in
//!   the user profile, which is wiped on a clean OS reinstall. Users who
//!   reimage should export their data first (a future Settings → Export
//!   feature can use plain JSON for portability).
//! - **Microsoft has the technical ability to decrypt** — if you log in
//!   with a Microsoft account, the recovery key is escrowed to MS. For
//!   local accounts there's no escrow. We do not advertise DPAPI as
//!   defense against a state-level adversary; it's defense against the
//!   "other user account / random disk read" threat.
//!
//! Output format:
//!   [1 byte: version=0x01][N bytes: DPAPI ciphertext]
//! Reading code checks the version byte and, if it's not 0x01, treats the
//! input as legacy plaintext JSON. This lets us migrate existing
//! installations transparently — the first write after upgrade re-protects
//! the value, and subsequent reads find the magic byte and decrypt.
